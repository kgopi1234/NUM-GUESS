	NUM GUESS (MINI PROJ – 1)

Problem Statement-
Build a number Guessing Game in which the user selects a range.
Assume the user selected a range from X to Y where both X and Y are integers.
So a random number in that range is selected by the system where the user needs to guess the 
minimum number of guesses.

Algorithm:
Get the range from the user.
Generate a random number in the range.
Initialize the number of guesses to 0.
Loop until the user guesses the number correctly.
In each iteration, get the user's guess.
Increment the number of guesses .
Check if the user's guess is correct. If it is, exit the loop. If not, provide a hint and continue the loop.

Pseudo Code:
INPUT num1, num2 // taking inputs from user							x = RANDOM(num1, num2)							guess_chance = 0 // initialize the number of guesses
WHILE true											guess = INPUT("Guess a number between x and y: ") // get the user's guess	guess-chance += 1 // increment the number of guesses
IF guess == x												PRINT “ Congratulations! your guess is correct.It took you {guess_chance} attempts.”												BREAK
  ELSE IF guess < x
    PRINT "your guess low than the number."
  ELSE
    PRINT "your guess high than the number."
END WHILE
Analysis of the Problem Statement
The problem statement requires us to build a number guessing game where the user selects a range and the system generates a random number in that range. The user needs to guess the number in the minimum number of guesses.
The key challenges in this problem are:
Generating a random number in the range
Implementing a loop that continues until the user guesses the number correctly
Providing hints to the user to help them guess the number correctly
The solution uses the random module to generate a random number in the range, and a while loop to continue until the user guesses the number correctly. The hints are provided using if-else statements to check if the user's guess is too low or too high.


* program : 


import random


def guessing_number():
    print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
    print("This is GOPI Guessing Master")
    print("You need to guess a number chosen by me ")
    num1 = int(input("Enter a start range: "))
    num2 = int(input("Enter an end range: "))
    x = random.randint(num1, num2)
    guess_chance = 0
    while True:
        guess = int(input(f"Guess a number between {num1} and {num2}: "))
        guess_chance += 1
        if x == guess:
            print(f"Congratulations! Your guess is correct. It took you {guess_chance} attempts.")
            break
        elif guess < x:
            print("Your guess is lower than the number.")
        else:
            print("Your guess is higher than the number.")
            
if __name__ =='__main__':
    guessing_number()



Output : Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
This is GOPI Guessing Master
You need to guess a number chosen by me    
Enter a start range: 3
Enter an end range: 6
Guess a number between 3 and 6: 4
Your guess is lower than the number.
Guess a number between 3 and 6: 5
Congratulations! Your guess is correct. It took you 2 attempts.
